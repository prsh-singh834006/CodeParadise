          <p>
            Working with Prashant was better than expected and we had really
            high expectations. He is an incredibly talented developer but what
            really makes him stand out is his work ethic and steady approach.
            Time after time, and without us asking, he added enhancements and
            improvements that resulted in a better end product for us and our
            clients.
