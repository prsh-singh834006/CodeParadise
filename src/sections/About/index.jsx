            A front-end developer's role is to combine design and business logic
            to achieve a user-facing product. To do this successfully, a wide
            skill set is necessary to produce a quality user experience that
            leads to meeting business goals. With my experience I can: Create
            responsive websites that work on a wide range of devices Assist with
            production of clean and functional design Bridge communication gap
            between designers and developers Integrate your website into an easy
            to use content management system
